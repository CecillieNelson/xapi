   * In order to selectively enable full class support in gwt,

   *
   * You MUST only send class literals to this method;
   * Class&lt;MyClass> cls = X_Reflect.magicClass(MyClass.class);
   *
   * Now you may use cls like any other class, to the extent provided by MagicClass,
   * and you may pass the variable around and use references to it in other X_Inject methods.
   * GWT.create() does not support magic classes, as we don't want to rewrite that method for anyone.
   * Use X_Inject.instance(), and it will default to GWT.create().
   * If you do use @InstanceOverride to inject a different class, it will also be instantiated w/ GWT.create().
   *
   * This method will call into a magic-method generator,
   * which pulls in all the required metadata at compile time,
   * and emits a "subclass" of java.lang.Class.
   *
   * This is completely illegal in java, but gwt is js, so anything goes.
   *
   * Rather than glob up a bunch of metadata into all class literals,
   * and cause terrible bloat across the app,
   * this method lets you select which classes you want full metadata on,
   * and which others will reduce to the typical, mostly-unsupported emulated Class.
   *
   * Note that for your gwt app to compile with references to the mostly unsupported class objects,
   * you must have xapi-super above gwt-user and gwt-dev on your classpath.
   * Our emulated class provides the method stubs, which throw exceptions to wrap objects w/ #magicClass.
